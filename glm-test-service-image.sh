# This script will verify that the OS image referred to
# in a corresponding Bare Metal OS service.yml is correct. This script will verify that it can
# download the OS image and check its length (in bytes) and signature. The script simulates what
# On-Premises Controller will do when it tries to download and verify an OS image.
# If this script fails then the service.yml file is most likely broken and will not work
# if loaded into the HPE Bare Metal Portal.

# Ways to use this script:
# * glm-test-service-image.sh sles.yml
